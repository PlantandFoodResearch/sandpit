This is a R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
set.seed(42)
a <- rnorm(1)
```


The random variable is set to `r a`.



```{r firstChunk}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r secondChunk, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
x <- rnorm(100000)

hist(x, breaks=100)

```
