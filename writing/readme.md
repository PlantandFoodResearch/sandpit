### Chapter 1

I'd like to be able to collaborate on writing using branches and forks and combinations of the two.

### Chapter 2

There are lots of benefits to using GitHub including:

* branches
* the user interface

### Chapter 3

Lorem ipsum dolor ...
We also need to know some git/wiki speak for headers etc but I guess prose comes in handy for that?????
